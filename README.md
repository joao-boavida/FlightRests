# FlightRests
A tool to help pilots and cabin crew calculate in-flight rest periods.

## Overview
This project is an iOS in-flight rest optimiser for flight and cabin crews. It is open source and built in SwiftUI. It aims to be as simple to use as possible and forgoes complex features in order to achieve that.

Feel free to contribute and comment.

## Disclaimer
The decision on how to organise in flight rest for crews remains with the responsible senior crew members. This app is only an aid to quickly calculate rest periods, and its results must be carefully checked before operational use.
